Auto Power-Off Switch using Arduino 

This is a simple project I created during my internship. 
The idea is to turn on an LED with a button, and then turn it off automatically after 10 seconds.

 What I did :
- When the button is pressed, the LED turns ON.
- After 10 seconds, the LED turns OFF automatically.
- I used millis() instead of delay() to keep the code running without pauses.

 Components used :
- Arduino Uno
- Push button
- LED
- Resistors
- Jumper wires

- The project was designed and simulated using wokwi.
